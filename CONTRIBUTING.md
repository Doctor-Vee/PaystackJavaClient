# Contributing

This OSS project has the following rules if you wish to contribute to it:

## General
- Fork the project to your own repo
- Clone the forked repo which is in your GitHub namespace and make your changes
- Push to you repo and create a pull request
- Add ChrisEteka as the reviewer
- In case there are failing pipelines, ensure to fix it before asking for review

## Code
- Try to follow the pattern we've agreed upon
- Try to bring in as minimal dependencies as possible
- Document any public class, method or field using Java Doc., if possible, add examples
- Update the [Goals](GOALS.md), and the [Readme](README.md) file when you achieve one of the goals set out

## Collaboration

Stay happy, learn and respect each other's opinion, give constructive feedbacks and expect one in return :wink:
